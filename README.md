A Minecraft mod about superability. The inspiration of AcademyCraft comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but the mod content is not limited of the background.

# About README-original.md

This file is a copy of the original `README` from the AcademyCraft project.

### Notice

This project has modified certain aspects of the original code, which may lead to differences in functionality from the version described in the original README. These modifications are intended to enhance or change specific features, and as a result, some features might behave differently from the original project.

For example, the original project included a feature that collected in-game usage data for analytics purposes, as described in its licensing agreement. However, this data collection feature has been **completely removed** in this forked version. The current version no longer collects any user data. Please refer to the updated `README.md` for the accurate description of the features and changes specific to this project.

**This forked version should be considered as the reference for the current state of the mod.**
