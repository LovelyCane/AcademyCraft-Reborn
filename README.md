## Modpack Permissions

Yes.

## Regarding Toaru Majutsu no Index

Many people inquire whether or how much the mod relates to _A Certain Magical Index_. While AcademyCraft is inspired by
_Railgun_, a spinoff of _Index_, the mod focuses solely on the science side of the story. It aims to provide an engaging
experience around the concept of **superability**, without delving deeply into the _Index_ storyline.
